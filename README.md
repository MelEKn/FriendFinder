Friend Finder App

Friend Finder is a website where users answer questions about their personality in order to find their best match for friendship. 

The user is given statements about themselves and asked to rank their response between 1, strongly disagree, and 5, strongly agree. Once they have submitted answers to all 10 questions, as well as their name and a link to an image of themselves, the app compares their answers with the responses for each character stored in the program, and returns their closest match. 

The survey questions used in this app were taken from the demo version of the site provided by Trilogy Education Services in the file "homework_instructions.md", available at the following site: https://friend-finder-fsf.herokuapp.com/


The characters used in this application are from the television show "Sense8", created by Lana and Lilly Wachowski and J. Michael Straczynski for Netflix. The photographs used were taken from IMDb's Sense8 Photo Gallery (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2431438/mediaindex?ref_=tt_pv_mi_sm). 

The Friend Finder App is deployed on Heroku here: https://nameless-oasis-89852.herokuapp.com/home
